Data Management Plan of research project on steelhead and habitat

Context:
My research is concerning steelhead salmon and the habitat they occupy in various Oregon watersheds. In my project I will be addressing questions regarding the relationship between different habitat characteristics, how changes in these habitat variables may impact steelhead populations, and how valuable some methods of data collection are compared to others in understanding this species.
