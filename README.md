Data Management Plan of research project on steelhead and habitat

Context:
My research is concerning steelhead salmon and the habitat they occupy in various Oregon watersheds. In my project I will be addressing questions regarding the relationship between different habitat characteristics, how changes in these habitat variables may impact steelhead populations, and how valuable some methods of data collection are compared to others in understanding these fish. 
I will be using existing datasets which have already been collected by others from Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. These data include:

1.	Surveys and describe various components of steelhead and coho salmon habitat along streams in Oregon as well as population data for each species. These data exist in multiple .csv files which I have been analyzing using R in R studio. 
2.	Spatial data which can be helpful in visualizing these habitat data while also layering in remotely sensed data about larger scale habitat data. These data are many different data types and are stored in a shared drive. They can be accessed and visualized by using ArcGIS, Python or R.
3.	Model outputs from a model called VELMA (Visualizing Ecosystem Land Management Assessments). These outputs include spatial layers related to hydrology and biochemistry. The outputs are ArcGIS layers and can be visualized by using ArcMap or other GIS platforms. 
4.	I hope to integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge in my project to help inform my models. This may include interviews and transcriptions. 

All of these data will all be useful in developing species distribution models for juvenile steelhead salmon. Species distribution models use multiple covariates to project the presence or absence of individuals. I will mainly use these habitat data to decide the covariates and other components of the model. I have not assessed the most influential habitat characteristics in determining the likelihood of presence or absence, but will likely run a series of linear regression models to evaluate the importance of things like number/percent of pools identified, percent of down woody debris, and percent of shade. These models will likely be run in R, Python and ArcGIS.
